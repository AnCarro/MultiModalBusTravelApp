# MultiModalBusTravelApp
Bus side app for multi-modal communication between a user and a bus

This is a simple bus tracking app. To install, simply move the APK to your phone and install it. 
You may need to change the settings on your phone to allow for unrecognized apps to be installed.

In order for the app to work, you must have a running Tomcat Server, or a server that provides identical functionality, including the Servlet names.
In order to do this, install Tomcat on your server, then deploy the server files, available in my different repository.
